# Focus Timer

**Focus Timer** is an app that implements the Pomodoro Timer. A user will do focused work
for 25 minutes, and then take 5 minutes of break - this is one cycle. This cycle repeats
4 more times; however, on the forth cycle, instead of 5 minutes of break, the user will
take 30 minutes of break.
