# Focus Timer

**Focus Timer** is an app that implements the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).
A user will do focused work for 25 minutes, and then take 5 minutes of break - this is one cycle. This cycle repeats
3 more times; however, on the forth cycle, instead of 5 minutes of break, the user will
take 30 minutes of break. Then, repeat.
